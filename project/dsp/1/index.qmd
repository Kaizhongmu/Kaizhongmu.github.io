**SRB Simulation Study**: This Shiny App is designed to show the simulation study results for my second research project under the mentorship of [Dr. Ani Eloyan](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/aeloyan). Our simulation involves multiple parameters (e.g., rate of decline, baseline severity, sample size). Static plots can only capture a few pre-selected scenarios, failing to show the full picture. So, I developed an interactive Shiny app to explore any combination of parameters in real-time.

**Project Details**: The detail could check in [A Bayesian Cognitive Change Method for Censored Longitudinal Data](../../../research.html#a-bayesian-cognitive-change-method-for-censored-longitudinal-data).
