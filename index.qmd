## I am
<p style="text-align: justify">   
    I am Statistics and AI enthusiast, which is rooted from my undergrad statistics study with combined both statistics theory and data science technique.
    </br>
    I am an independent researcher, who recently transitioned from a research assistant during my master’s studies in biostatistics.
    </br>
    I am from a family of doctors, which sparked my interest in solving real-world biomedical challenge.
    </br>
    I am a sailor who’s been drifting at sea for a month. 
    </br>
    I am a driver who once crossed America after graduation. 
    </br>
    I am a thinker who likes to ponder the universe on the toilet. 
    </br>
    I am an international student, so mandarin is my 1st language, and statistics is 2nd.
</p>

## I believe
<p style="text-align: justify">   
    Statistics and AI are stand in a yin-yang relationship: AI's black-box nature requires statistical theory to increase interpretability, while statistics methodology should embrace data-driven technique to boost practical impact. 
    </br>
    Good researchers should hold themselves to higher standards: must deeply understand the mathematical principles and statistical meaning behind models, stay open to new techniques and theories, quiet devotion to creating something both rigorous.
    </br>
    Nature has much to teach us—about science, about love, about the beauty of simplicity.
