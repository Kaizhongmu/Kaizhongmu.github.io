   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rispace.github.io.git
   cd <your-username>.github.io
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**

   ```  
   
   Then from the settings of your repository, set the GitHub Pages source to the `gh-pages` branch.

4. **Install Quarto**

   Follow the instructions [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to install Quarto on your machine.

### Customization

1. **Update Configuration**

   Edit the `_quarto.yml` file to update your siteâ€™s title, description, and other configurations.

2. **Add Your Content**

   - **Homepage**: Edit the `index.qmd` file with your personal information.
   - **Blog Posts**: Add new blog posts in the `blog` directory. Use the `.qmd` format for your posts.
   - **Assets**: Place your images and other assets in the `assets` directory.

3. **Customize Styles**

   If you want to customize the look and feel of your site, modify the CSS files in the `styles` directory.

### Building and Deploying


1. **Build the site locally**

   To preview your site locally, run the following command:

   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```

   This will generate the static files in the `docs` directory.

2. **Render the site using GitHub Actions**

   This template uses GitHub Actions for rendering. The rendering process is set up in the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file. You can modify this file to change the rendering settings if needed. For my case, it has both renv and python environments, so it will render both R and Python code chunks. But if you only use R or Python, you can remove the unnecessary parts. These environments are only required if you use R or Python code chunks in your website. If you only use markdown, you can remove the `renv` and `python` parts.

   ```bash
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
     push:
       branches: main

   name: Quarto Publish
