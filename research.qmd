## Research Projects

### An Inherent Bayesian RNN Method for MNAR Longitudinal Data
**Advisor:** Dr. Ani Eloyan  
**Duration:** 09/25 – Present

- This thesis project further extends Project 2, by relaxing two assumptions—linear relationship and constant practical effect—and by generalizing the SRB framework from single to multiple follow-ups longitudinal study
- Developed a novel RNN algorithm by introducing Bayesian Inference into redesigned loss function and optimization strategy, enabling the model to inherently handle missing-not-at-random data without prior imputation.
- To be presented as a poster at Brown University in April 2026.

### A Bayesian Cognitive Change Method for MNAR Longitudinal Data
**Advisor:** Dr. Ani Eloyan  
**Duration:** 01/25 – Present

- Designed simulation study & R Shiny App that evaluate SRB method underestimates cognitive change in Severe dementia whose follow-ups censored at floor of NACC test battery in Longitudinal EOAD Study (LEADs)
- Developed SRB-extended method by introducing Bayesian Inference in treating missingness as random variable through a selection model-based likelihood.
- Realized the proposed method through MCMC (HM algorithm), with R stan code developed in supplement materials
- Designed simulation study & Applied in LEADs Data that demonstrate the proposed method reduce the underestimation while preserved the interpretability aspect of the SRB index and offered credible intervals for uncertainty quantified
- Resulted in a manuscript under submission to "Alzheimer's & Dementia Journal" and presentations at three conferences.

### Nonlinear Mixed Effect Model for Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker
**Advisor:** Dr. Ani Eloyan  
**Duration:** 09/24 – 12/24

- Conducted literature reviews on vivo Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarker (tau-PET, WMH in MRI) and Spline modeling techniques (B-spline, Natural-spline, penalized-spline)
- Constructed a P-spline design matrix based on cubic B-spline basis function within mixed-effects framework to model the nonlinear increment of White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) volume in longitudinal MRI data.

### Translational Medical Research Collaboration
**Collaborator:** Dr. Dinara Ryspayeva, Dr. Attila Seyhan. Legorreta Cancer Center  
**Duration:** 03/25 – 09/25

- Led and conducted a full pipeline of statistical analyses for breast cancer miRNA biomarker discovery —including missing data imputation, survival data collection guidance, survival analysis.
- Identified MAR assumption via sensitivity analyses and applied conditional mean imputation for missing data
- Built Cox regression model to evaluate the predictive associations of miR-34a, miR-137, miR-373, miR-124a, and miR-155 with overall survival, taking account for both biological interpretability (up/down regulation, interactions) and statistical rigor (PH assumption, multicollinearity, influential point).
- Resulted in a manuscript currently under submission to "World Journal of Clinical Oncology"

### Health Data Science Summer Fellowship Program
**Advisor:** Dr. Alyssa Bilinski  
**Duration:** 06/25 – 08/25

- Received training in data tidying in R, visualization in Tableau, data management in SQL, and causal inference.
- Applied Large Language Model (LLMs) (OpenAI) for free-text classification of public response to private equity, aiming to evaluate and improve prompt effectiveness in domain-specific text understanding.
- Built an automated evaluation pipeline and interactive Shiny App to benchmark AI annotations against human ground truth.
- Resulted in oral presentation to program faculty and fellows at the final symposium.

### Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Unemployment Prediction
**Advisor:** Dr. Colin Cameron  
**Duration:** 12/22 – 03/23

- Collected and managed unemployment related data through APIs, web scraping (BeautifulSoup) in Python
- Implemented and Compared multiple regression models, including OLS, LASSO, and a novel dimension-reduced local weighted regression applying PCA, for unemployment rate prediction.
- Evaluated and visualized model results in Stata and RStudio, using key metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), and R-squared, accuracy, and efficiency.

### Graph-Based Change-Point Detection Method for High-Dimensional Network Data
**Advisor:** Dr. Hao Chen, Assoc. Prof. of Statistics, UCD  
**Duration:** 09/22 – 01/23

- Conducted literature reviews on graph theory and graph models (Stochastic Block Models, Erdős–Rényi graphs and Configuration Model)
- Refined gSeg R-package, implementing a combination of Image Analysis and SCAN statistics test in detecting change-point in dynamic social networks, while optimizing the algorithms for computational efficiency and scalability
- Designed and conducted simulation studies in R to evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed method against conventional approaches, across different levels of graph sparsity, edge density, and network connectivity
