## Research Interests

I'm drawn to the Bayesian approach to thinking about uncertainty, so its application to biomedical data is of interest to me. I am interested in the MCMC and Variational Inference for large data sets, the use of Bayesian methods in deep learning, the use of Bayesian methods to model heterogeneity. I have an ongoing project integrating Bayesian with RNN in inherently handling missing not at random (MNAR) data. I have a post project extending a cognitive measurement method under the Bayesian framework to handle MNAR.

## My Story

The story of Bayesian statistics and me began with a research project where I encountered a non-identifiability issue using MLE to fit a mixed-effects model. Hearing that Bayesian inference might offer a solution, I enrolled in a Bayesian course and received systematic trainingâ€”from explicit likelihood to MCMC methods for non-explicit likelihood. As the course was ending, another project of mine reached the stage of developing new methods. Bayesian thinking inspired me to address missing-not-at-random data without imposing the strong assumptions required by the frequentist framework, thereby improving the model's applicability. Building on this, I am now conducting Bayesian inference under an RNN architecture to handle MNAR data. Looking ahead, I hope to explore Bayesian applications in large-scale biomedical data, as I found standard MCMC computation increasingly challenging as data size grew in my last project.
