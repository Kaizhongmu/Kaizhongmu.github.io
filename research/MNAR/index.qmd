## Interest Keywords

I'm drawn to the Bayesian approach to thinking about uncertainty, so its application to biomedical data is of interest to me. I am interested in the MCMC and Variational Inference for large data sets, the use of Bayesian methods in deep learning, the semi-parametric Bayesian. I have an ongoing project integrating Bayesian with RNN in simultaneously handles MNAR/MAR missingness and left-censoring in Alzheimer's longitudinal data. I have a post project extending a cognitive measurement method under the Bayesian framework to handle left-censored data.

## Related Story

The story of Bayesian statistics and me began with a research project where I encountered a non-identifiability issue when using MLE to fit a mixed-effects model. Learning that Bayesian inference might offer a solution, I enrolled in a Bayesian course and received systematic trainingâ€”from explicit likelihood to MCMC methods for non-explicit likelihoods. As the course concluded, another project of mine entered the stage of method development. The Bayesian framework inspired me to address left-censored data with a simpler mathematical formulation while providing uncertainty quantification for clinicians. Building on this foundation, I am now conducting Bayesian inference under an RNN architecture to handle MNAR and left-censored data simultaneously.
