## Related Story

- **2021**: Undergraduate time-series coursework sparked my interest in time-dependent data, particularly in estimation under temporal dependence.
- **2022**: Dr. Colin Cameron mentored my first independent research on applying machine learning to time-series prediction. Beyond technical skills, his rigor and passion for research deeply shaped my academic mindset.
- **2024-2025**: Dr. Ani Eloyan introduced me to biostatistical research in Alzheimer's disease and guided me into longitudinal data analysis. I am grateful for her trust and support in allowing me to lead two projects, through which I developed Bayesian integration methods for handling censored and missing data and further extended a Bayesian-based RNN to simultaneously address both challenges in EOAD longitudinal datasets.
