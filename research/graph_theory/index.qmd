I am deeply grateful to Dr. Hao Chen for introducing me to graph theory during my first research project, where it was applied to detect change points in social network data. This experience opened doors to numerous possibilities like high-dimensional data, omic data, neuroimaging. These are all areas I hope to explore further if the opportunity arises.
