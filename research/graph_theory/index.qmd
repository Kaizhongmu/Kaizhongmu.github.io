## Research Interests

I really enjoy contemplating intricate relationships filled with various correlations, so I'm interested in graph theory and its applicationsâ€”such as network data, imaging, and omics.

## My Story

I am deeply grateful to Dr. Hao Chen for introducing me to graph theory during my first research project, where it was applied to detect change points in social network data. This experience opened doors to numerous possibilities like I mentioned above. These are all areas I hope to explore further if the opportunity arises.
